## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding a New Theme

Themes are defined directly inside `index.html`.

Add a new CSS selector using the `data-theme` attribute:

```css
[data-theme="your-theme"] {
    --bg-dim: #...;
    --bg-main: #...;
    --bg-soft: #...;
    --bg-element: #...;

    --fg-main: #...;
    --fg-muted: #...;

    --accent: #...;
    --accent-secondary: #...;

    --success: #...;
    --error: #...;
}
```

Then add the theme to the theme selector:

```html
<option value="your-theme">Your Theme Name</option>
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Is my API key safe?

Your API key is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`.

Melissa does not have a backend and does not send your key anywhere except the API service required to generate AI responses.

> For maximum security, avoid using API keys that you do not want exposed in a client-side application.

---

### Can I use Melissa without an internet connection?

No.

Melissa needs an internet connection to communicate with Google's Gemini API.

---

### Can I use a different AI model?

Currently, Melissa supports Google's Gemini API.

Support for other AI providers such as Claude and OpenAI may be added in the future.

---

### Why don't responses use Markdown?

Melissa intentionally uses clean, plain text responses.

The goal is to keep the chat interface simple, readable, and distraction-free.
